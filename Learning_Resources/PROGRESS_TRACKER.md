## Upcoming Work

### 🔜 Day 2: Control Flow - Loops & Lists (NEXT)
- **Planned Topics:**
  - For loops
  - While loops
  - Lists (storing multiple values)
  - Dictionaries (organizing data)
- **Planned Project:** Multi-stock portfolio tracker
- **Goal:** Track 10+ stocks simultaneously without writing repetitive code

### 📅 Day 3-7: Remaining Week 1
- Functions and reusable code
- File I/O
- Error handling
- Building modular trading tools

---

## Weekly Goals

### Week 1 Goal
**Master Python Fundamentals**
- Variables, data types, operators ✅
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modules
- Basic data structures
- File operations

**End of Week 1 Milestone:**
- Should be able to write clean, modular Python code
- Should be comfortable with loops and functions
- Should be able to read/write CSV files with stock data

## Learning Velocity Notes
- **Augustine's pace:** Fast learner, concepts clicking immediately
- **Current assessment:** Can likely accelerate through basic Python (Weeks 1-2)
- **Recommendation:** If Week 1 continues to be "easy," consider condensing Weeks 1-2 into 1.5 weeks
- **Strength areas:** Logic, problem-solving, independent work
- **Next challenge point:** Likely around Week 3-4 when NumPy/Pandas complexity increases
