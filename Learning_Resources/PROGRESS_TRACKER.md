## Notes for Continuation

When returning to this chat:
1. Say "Ready for Day 3" or reference current day
2. Mention any questions from previous day
3. Share any additional practice
4. Let me know if you want to accelerate/maintain pace

**Current Pace Recommendation:**
Given your performance on Day 1-2, you can:
- Complete Week 1 in 4-5 days instead of 7
- Skip some beginner exercises
- Add more challenging projects
- Accelerate to NumPy/Pandas by Week 2

**Remember:** Keep this chat active for continuity. I can see all previous context in the same thread.
