   - Any blocks or confusion
   - Code for review if applicable

---

## Notes from Initial Conversation
- You learn quickly - Day 1 concepts were "easy, basics"
- You prefer practical application over theory
- You understand boolean shortcuts intuitively
- Strong grasp of formatting (:.2f explanation was perfect)
- Independent problem solver (completed optional challenge without hints)

---

## What Makes This Plan Different
- **No certifications needed** - Portfolio strength is what matters
- **18-24 month realistic timeline** - Not 3-month get-rich-quick
- **Focus on rigor over sophistication** - One solid strategy beats five mediocre ones
- **Boring strategies executed well** - Discipline in backtesting and risk management
- **Clear presentation** - Document everything for employers to scan quickly

## Interview Preparation Focus
Firms will drill into your portfolio:
