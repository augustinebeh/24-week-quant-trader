## 🎓 Learning Methodology

### Daily Workflow
1. **Study:** 2-4 hours focused learning
2. **Code:** Hands-on implementation
3. **Document:** Log progress and insights
4. **Review:** Reflect on concepts learned
5. **Test:** Write test cases for validation

### Key Principles
- **Practical over Theoretical:** Every concept implemented in code
- **Test-Driven:** Write tests to validate understanding
- **Documentation First:** All strategies thoroughly documented
- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, professional code from day one
- **Honest Assessment:** Clear about limitations and failures

## 📖 Resources

### Books
- *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* - Marcos López de Prado
- *Market Microstructure in Practice*
- *Evidence-Based Technical Analysis*
- *Systematic Trading* - Rob Carver

### Online Courses
- MIT OpenCourseWare (Computer Science, Statistics)
- 3Blue1Brown (Linear Algebra)
- Khan Academy (Finance)
- Quantopian archived courses

### Research
- SSRN academic papers
- arXiv quant finance papers
- Trading communities and forums

## 🎯 Portfolio Goals

By completion, this repository will contain **3-5 complete trading strategies** with:
- ✅ Clear documentation and README for each strategy
- ✅ Clean, tested, production-quality Python code
- ✅ Comprehensive backtest results with visualizations
- ✅ Risk metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate, etc.)
- ✅ Honest assessment of limitations and edge cases
- ✅ Blog articles explaining methodologies

## 🔍 What Firms Look For

This journey focuses on demonstrating:
1. **Rigorous backtesting methodology** - Not just results, but process
2. **Clear analytical thinking** - Why strategies work (or don't)
3. **Code quality** - Readable, reproducible, professional
4. **Intellectual honesty** - Transparent about limitations

> *"One really solid strategy with thorough documentation beats five half-baked ones."*

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Technical Skills:** Master Python, statistics, and backtesting frameworks
- **Strategy Development:** Build 3-5 deployable trading strategies
- **Portfolio Quality:** GitHub-ready work that demonstrates capability
- **Interview Readiness:** Ability to defend strategies and discuss edge cases

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/augustinebeh/24-week-quant-trader-journey.git

# Navigate to project
cd 24-week-quant-trader-journey

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check current progress
cat Learning_Resources/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md

# Run Day 1 exercises
python3 "Day 1/basic_variable.py"
python3 "Day 1/test_basics_variable.py"

# Run Day 2 exercises
python3 "Day 2/portfolio_tracker.py"
python3 "Day 2/test_portfolio.py"
```

## 💡 Why This Approach?

**No Certifications Needed:** Portfolio strength demonstrates capability better than certificates.

**Realistic Timeline:** 18-24 months of dedicated work (20-30 hrs/week) to be genuinely competitive.

**Focus on Fundamentals:** Boring, testable strategies executed with discipline beat flashy algorithms.

**Build in Public:** Document the journey for accountability and to demonstrate communication skills.

**Test-Driven Development:** Write tests from day one to ensure code quality and understanding.
