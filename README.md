## 🎓 Learning Methodology

### Daily Workflow
1. **Study:** 2-4 hours focused learning
2. **Code:** Hands-on implementation
3. **Document:** Log progress and insights
4. **Review:** Reflect on concepts learned
5. **Test:** Write test cases for validation

### Key Principles
- **Practical over Theoretical:** Every concept implemented in code
- **Test-Driven:** Write tests to validate understanding
- **Documentation First:** All strategies thoroughly documented
- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, professional code from day one
- **Honest Assessment:** Clear about limitations and failures

## 📖 Resources

### Books
- *Advances in Financial Machine Learning* - Marcos López de Prado
- *Market Microstructure in Practice*
- *Evidence-Based Technical Analysis*
- *Systematic Trading* - Rob Carver

### Online Courses

## 💡 Why This Approach?

**No Certifications Needed:** Portfolio strength demonstrates capability better than certificates.

**Realistic Timeline:** 18-24 months of dedicated work (20-30 hrs/week) to be genuinely competitive.

**Focus on Fundamentals:** Boring, testable strategies executed with discipline beat flashy algorithms.

**Build in Public:** Document the journey for accountability and to demonstrate communication skills.

**Test-Driven Development:** Write tests from day one to ensure code quality and understanding.
